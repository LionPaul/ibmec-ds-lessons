/*
It's possible to write programs in C in different ways. 
What defines their operation has nothing to do with correct indentation, 
but rather with the command lines. Therefore, different writing styles are accepted by the computer. 
Acceptance doesn't mean correct or a good practice.

//Exemple one 
/* 
#include <stdio.h> int main () { printf("Hello, World!\n"); return 0; }
*/

//Exemple two
/* 
#include <stdio.h>                            int main ()
 { printf("Hello, World!\n");
  
                                                return 0; }
